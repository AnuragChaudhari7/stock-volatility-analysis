## Overview  
Provide a concise summary of your project's goals. For example:  
>This project analyzes historical stock price data to quantify volatility, explore trends, and compare volatility estimation methods (e.g., GARCH models, moving averages, or LSTM). It aims to support better risk management and forecasting.

## Features
- Calculation of historical volatility from stock price returns
- Comparative analysis of volatility estimation techniques
- Visualizations of volatility trends over time
- Optionally, forecasting using machine learning or deep learning models

## Technologies & Dependencies  
List core technologies, including libraries and tools. Example:
- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- Optional: `arch` (for GARCH), `torch` or `tensorflow` (for deep learning)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have:
- Python 3.8+
- `pip` (or `conda`)

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AnuragChaudhari7/stock‑volatility‑analysis.git
