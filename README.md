## Overview  
Provide a concise summary of your project's goals. For example:  
>This project analyzes historical stock price data to quantify volatility, explore trends, and compare volatility estimation methods (e.g., GARCH models, moving averages, or LSTM). It aims to support better risk management and forecasting.

## Features
- Calculation of historical volatility from stock price returns
- Comparative analysis of volatility estimation techniques
- Visualizations of volatility trends over time
- Optionally, forecasting using machine learning or deep learning models

## Technologies & Dependencies  
List core technologies, including libraries and tools. Example:
- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- Optional: `arch` (for GARCH), `torch` or `tensorflow` (for deep learning)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have:
- Python 3.8+
- `pip` (or `conda`)

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AnuragChaudhari7/stock‑volatility‑analysis.git
cd stock‑volatility‑analysis
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage
```bash
jupyter notebook src/analysis.ipynb
```
Alternatively, run scripts from the src/ folder (if applicable):

```
python src/compute_volatility.py --symbol AAPL --start 2020-01-01 --end 2025-01-01
```

### Project Structure
Example layout (adjust to your own):
```

│   ├── compute_volatility.py
│   └── data_utils.py
├── data/
│   ├── raw/
│   └── processed/
├── requirements.txt
└── README.md
```
### Results & Insights
Summarize key takeaways or findings. For instance:

"Volatility spikes during market downturns (e.g., March 2020)."

"GARCH models capture volatility clustering effectively, outperforming simple rolling window approaches".

### Potential Improvements
Incorporate GARCH/GJR‑GARCH/EGARCH models

Add deep learning forecasts (e.g., using LSTM)

Fetch real-time data from financial APIs (e.g., yfinance)

Build an interactive dashboard (e.g., with Streamlit or Dash)
